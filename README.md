# reproducibleFigures
Files for Question 2 of the Reproducible Figures computer assignment.

The question2.rmd file can be knitted once all files have been downloaded and the needed packages are installed. It contains some code that needs to be taken out of comments if the figures and data are not also downloaded, and the line to install packages is commented initially. The knitted .rmd file also does not show loading in packages, but the original code can be seen in the .rmd file.
